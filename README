Instructions for use of this development version of SuperPhriends Navigator.
===============================================================================

IMPORTANT: a database file for sqlite3 must be created first and foremost.

1. ./launch.sh will create a new bash shell and seek out the local
configuration for this shell.  SuperPhriends Navigator will also 
be configured at this time.  

2. (Required only once) ./sqlite_rocket 
Then follow the instructions for creating a new database.

===============================================================================

Goals: 	1. Make this development version presentable to other honored Github
users who might fall upon my work. 
	2. Finish the database development effort.
	3. Finish the user interface development effort.



To Do:

1.	Get rid of the bash_alaises script!

	The specials should all be in bash_tui.

2.	Get a licence in the repository.
